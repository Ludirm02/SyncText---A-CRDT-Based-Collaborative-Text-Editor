# SyncText---A-CRDT-Based-Collaborative-Text-Editor
We’ve developed a real-time collaborative editing system similar to Google Docs, leveraging CRDTs (Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types) with lock-free programming. This approach ensures efficient, conflict-free collaboration by enabling real-time, distributed editing without locks, providing a seamless user experience across multiple devices.
